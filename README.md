# odin-rockpaperscissors
## The classic game of rock, paper, scissors in your browser! 🪨📄✂️
A simple implementation of the grade-school classic, “rock paper scissors”:
- Click the corresponding button to choose rock 🪨, paper 📄, or scissors ✂️ for that round. 
- The round winner gets 1 point. A round ending in a draw / tie between the player and computer does not award any points.
- The first one to reach 5 points wins the game!

My iteration of this project adheres to the guidelines set out by the maintainers of **The Odin Project**, a self-paced curriculum for learning web development (links at the bottom).

**Why did I complete this project?:** 
- To better understand and practice using functions, conditional statements, and JavaScript and  for basic web page interactivity. 
- To learn how to create, work on, merge, and delete git branches.

## What I Learned
- "Magic Numbers" are numbers used directly, without an assigned meaning in code. It is best practice to replace magic numbers with meaningful variable names to improve code readability.
- How to create and call functions, with or without parameters, like this: function(parameter);
- How to use setAttribute() to set unique element IDs, and document.getElementbyId() to select and manipulate elements in the DOM.
- Template literals (Using backticks (`) instead of quotes ("") for text strings, in combination with variables formatted like this: ${variable} to make string concantenation with variables simpler).
- How to use strict equality (===) and logical AND operators (&&) to logically compare the exact value and data type of multiple variables.
- How to use .addEventListener() to track user events, like mouse clicks, on DOM elements.
